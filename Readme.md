### To Test
- Snapshot broadcast reaches party members when not in a raid
- Test roll cleanup runs periodically without affecting live rolls
- Loot history mismatch detection still catches vote discrepancies
- Solo simulate-items uses the consolidated vote popup and records all test player votes

### Class/Spec System

The addon includes a comprehensive database of all WoW classes with their specs, armor types, and weapon preferences:

- **Armor Types**: Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate
- **Weapon Preferences**: Per-spec weapon type mappings (2H, 1H+Shield, 1H+Offhand, etc.)
- **Role Detection**: Automatic role assignment from talent specs

### Spec Synchronization

Player specifications are automatically detected via:
- Inspect API queue with rate limiting (0.3s between calls)
- Caching to reduce API calls
- Event listeners for mid-session spec changes
- Integration with raid group roster updates
